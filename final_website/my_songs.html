    <p>Another one of my favorite songs is the first song I ever composed, that really started my musical journey. It's called "What You See In Me" and the song emphasizes values of friendship, forgiveness and moving forward in life.</p>

    <p>The Lyrics of this song follow:</p>
    <br>
    <p>The wind is howling I can see it now</p>
    <p>She’s right below us, her breath so perfect</p>
    <p>The window is open, the birds are flying high</p>
    <p>And I can see it now, now that you’ve thrown out the disguise</p>

    <p>The beauty of friendship lies</p>
    <p>And you know it, you know it too</p>
    <p>And you can see it from the first day that we met</p>
    <p>From the first day that you saw it in me, whatever you did</p>

    <p>Cause I can see it now, and it is reaching, coming for you</p>
    <p>And you know it too, you just keep on reaching out for me</p>
    <p>The trust you have I know that it will last for eternity</p>
    <p>And you know it too, cause you keep on coming back for me</p>

    <p>And now it’s clear that I have done some things</p>
    <p>That may for not have turned out for the best</p>
    <p>But you kept coming, you kept on believing in me, and you tried</p>
    <p>And you pushed me so I could see what you saw in me</p>

    <p>The window is finally open</p>
    <p>The flowers and seeds have blossomed</p>
    <p>And now it’s perfectly clear that a whole new world is there</p>

    <p>So now I can see that you were right in front of me</p>
    <p>And I made mistakes, and you helped me learn from them</p>
    <p>And you know it too, you kept on trying, coming for me</p>
    <p>And you know it too, it is what you see in me</p>

    <p>So, what do you see?</p>
    <p>Why do you believe in me?</p>
    <p>And why did I choose?</p>
    <p>Why did I fight for you?</p>

    <p>Now it’s clear that everything you did, you did for me</p>
    <p>And everything I did for you</p>
    <p>And the bonds we have will last through eternity</p>
    <p>Through eternity</p>
    <p>As long you believe in me</p>
    <p>As long as you see what I used to see</p>

    <p>And now that’s its clear</p>
    <p>The window is open, and you believe in me</p>
    <p>If only I believed in you</p>
    <p>And now that’s its clear</p>
    <p>That you found your place in time</p>
    <p>It’s only a matter before</p>
    <p>Before I saw what you see in me</p>

    <p>What you saw in me</p>
