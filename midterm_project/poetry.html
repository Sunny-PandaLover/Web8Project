    <h1>Below is a poem I made about the beauty of Alpenglows:</h1>
    <h2>Some themes that this poem reflects are belonging, struggle, love, hope and empowerment </h2>
        <p>Shimmery curtains</p>
        <p>The house that we built</p>
        <p>Upon nothing but bricks and stone</p>
        <p>My sweet, scented lilac perfume</p>
        <p>The late night talks about our life</p>
        <p>Oh, how we've grown</p>
        <p>7 in the morning</p>
        <p>You ready in your maroon colored dress</p>
        <p>The one that I stitched in pearls for you</p>
        <p>We are finally having the life that we've always wanted</p>
        <p>Then why does it all feel so wrong?</p>
        <p>Life would be too confusing if we knew all the answers</p>
        <p>Isn’t that what you told me?</p>
        <br>
        <p>The looks and stares that we always get</p>
        <p>When after all we are just like everyone else</p>
        <p>Human beings who are scared</p>
        <p>Scared of what their friends and family will think of them</p>
        <p>Scared of what the world will think of them</p>
        <p>Scared that the person they once knew is slowly disappearing like each tick on a watch</p>
        <br>
        <p>But in the end we both stay hopeful</p>
        <p>That the next alpenglow will bring us both peace</p>
        <p>That we can be who we want to be</p>
        <p>Without all the judgements in this world</p>
        <p>Without the lingering feeling that every second in time together, our lives are getting picked apart</p>
        <p>Like someone putting together all the wrong puzzle pieces and realizing that everything they ever made was wrong
        Out of place</p>
        <br>
        <p>I think it’s truly beautiful</p>
        <p>Time and how it heals you, changes you</p>
        <p>If only all of us could see that there isn’t room for more hate in this world</p>
        <br>
        <p>But maybe someday in this world we'll finally be able to be acknowledged as humans</p>
        <p>And we won't be called mistakes</p>
        <p>We won't be shamed</p>
        <p>We won't be silenced</p>
        <p>We won’t be picked apart</p>
        <p>Because it’s okay to fall, it’s okay to break, it’s okay to be hopeless but what it’s never okay to do is to give up</p>
        <br>
        <p>Because no one is truly fearless</p>
        <p>Despite how many times they try convincing themselves that they're not afraid of something or that the fear that they once had is gone, it’s always there</p>
        <p>And we may never be able to eradicate that aspect of us</p>
        <p>Our mistakes that end up leading to the journey</p>
        <p>The journey that led us to the alpenglow</p>
        <br>
        <p>Because at the top of that mountain we can finally watch the reddish glow near the sunset on the summit of the mountains illuminate</p>
        <p>It will give us the courage to make the jump</p>
        <p>We may not know where we will jump but that doesn't matter</p>
        <p>Sometimes in life you have to jump, even though you may not know where you're going to land</p>
        <br>
        <p>And finally at that moment we'll be able to hold our hands with pride</p>
        <p>We’ll be able to wear clothing where the rainbow hearts of comfort are there to make us feel special, acknowledged</p> 
        <p>Not as mistakes to this world, but as people who have fears that don't let that stop them from making the most out of their lives</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p style="font-size: 40px; color:rgb(72, 21, 120); text-align: center;">We’ll be able to wave our flags painted in stripes of pink, purple and blue</p>
